# Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


The full stack burger-logger web app featuring the use of Node, Express server, Handlebars for view generation. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data flow in the app. 

The app is fully functional and can be cloned to run and test locally.  

Application was sucessfully deployed to HEROKU; however the jawsdb free add on required credit card information. For security purposes and the possiblity of credit card fraud, I will not be adding it to my HEROKU account.
